# Legal Document Analysis System 📚⚖️

A comprehensive legal document analysis tool that provides multiple functionalities including extractive and abstractive summarization, named entity recognition, and legal Q&A capabilities.

## Features 🌟

### 1. Extractive Summarization 📝
- Extracts key points from legal documents
- Identifies related cases from the database
- Shows metadata including court information and document links
- Displays relevant points from similar cases

### 2. Abstractive Summarization ✍️
- Generates concise, human-readable summaries
- Handles long documents by splitting into chunks
- Maintains context through overlapping chunks
- Provides downloadable summary output

### 3. Named Entity Recognition 🔍
- Identifies legal entities using specialized legal NER model
- Compares results with general-purpose SpaCy NER
- Visualizes entity recognition results
- Supports multiple entity types

### 4. Legal Q&A System ❓
- Interactive chat interface for legal queries
- Uses InLegalBERT for semantic understanding
- Retrieves relevant context from legal database
- Powered by Gemini 2.5 Pro for accurate responses

## Data Setup 📊

This repository contains only the codebase. To run the application, you'll need to:

1. **Download or prepare your legal dataset:**
   - Place legal documents in a `data/` directory
   - Ensure documents are in PDF format

2. **Initialize ChromaDB:**
   ```bash
   python setup_chroma.py
   ```

3. **Generate embeddings:**
   ```bash
   # Run the embedding notebook to populate ChromaDB
   jupyter notebook notebooks/embedding.ipynb
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file with your API keys
   echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
   ```
